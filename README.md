Python project for Movie and Tv Metadata analysis with Genres and Ratings (2023)

Project Overview:

This project focuses on analyzing an IMDb-style dataset of movies and TV shows using Python. The goal is to clean the data, explore relationships between features (like rating, genre, runtime, and votes), and extract meaningful insights through visualizations and summaries.

Dataset Columns:

movie, genre, certificate, rating, runtime, stars, description, votes, director.

Data Cleaning:

1. Removed duplicates
2. Converted columns (e.g., runtime from "120 min" → 120)
3. Handled missing values
4. Cleaned votes (removed commas, converted to int)

Insight:
Most movie ratings seem to be clustered around the 6–8 range, suggesting that movies generally get average to good reviews.

2. Movies with Highest Votes

Insight:

i. Movies with the most votes are usually the most popular and watched by a lot of people.

ii. A high number of votes can also mean that fans are very active or the movie was well-promoted.

iii. These top-voted movies are often part of big movie series (franchises), showing that they have a large number of fans.

3. Plot the genre breakdown
